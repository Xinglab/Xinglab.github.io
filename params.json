{"name":"Xing Laboratory of RNA Genomics and Bioinformatics","tagline":"Welcome to the Xing Laboratory of RNA Genomics and Bioinformatics!","body":"### Current Research Topics:\r\nThe long-term goal of our research is to elucidate how genomic and environmental variation of RNA regulatory networks impacts phenotypic traits and diseases. We are a hybrid computational and experimental lab. We combine genomic, bioinformatic, molecular, and network approaches to study mRNA processing and post-transcriptional gene regulation in mammalian cells. We develop novel computational and statistical methods for analysis of massive genome and transcriptome data. We integrate computational studies with high-throughput and experimental research to systematically investigate the variation and dynamics of RNA regulatory networks between species, within human populations, and in response to developmental and disease signals. \r\n\r\n### Recent News\r\n* Nov 2014: Shihao and Juw Won's rMATS paper has been accepted for publication by PNAS. rMATS is a computational tool to detect differential alternative splicing events from replicate RNA-Seq data. [rMATS software]\r\n\r\n* Oct 2014: Shihao received a 2-year Human Biology Fellowship from the Huntington’s Disease Society of America (HDSA) on “Transcriptome Isoform Networks in Huntington’s Disease”. Congratulations! [HDSA press release]\r\n\r\n* Oct 2014: We received a Developmental Research Program Award from the UCLA SPORE in Prostate Cancer.\r\nSep 2014: Jinkai's work in collaboration with Drs. Cosmas Giallourakis (MGH) and Howard Chang (Stanford) on m6A RNA methylation of mammalian embryonic stem cells is in press at Cell Stem Cell.\r\n\r\n* Sep 2014: We received a 2-year R01 grant from the NIH Roadmap Initiative to study epigenomic control of RNA processing.\r\n\r\n* Aug 2014: Our work in collaboration with Dr. Yang Shi (Harvard) on a chromatin regulator of intron retention has been accepted for publication by Molecular Cell.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
